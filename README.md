## Introduction

K-Lazer is a project aiming to provide an interface from which teachers can interact with and engage their students. The project is designed to facilitate 
teaching with the use of a computer or interactive whiteboard, using a simple, sleek, and highly customizable overlay, made using the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/).  

K-Lazer comes with many features to help teachers in their lessons, all designed to be easy to access, so that they can focus on their class. 
These include a customizable laser pointer, annotation support, and screen shot / recording capabilties; all just a click away.

## Usage

To download and use K-Lazer, you must first meet the prerequisite criteria.  
After you have checked that the criteria are met, read and follow the instructions to download and run K-Lazer, as detailed below.  
Following that, read the [Usage Guide](https://github.com/OneBigUnit/K-Lazer/blob/Build/Usage%20Guide.md), which details how to use the app once downloaded and run.

### Prerequisites

To use K-Lazer, you need to ensure your system:
* Operates using the [Windows OS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows?r=1)
* Has at least 100MB of disk storage available

### Downloading & Running

From the repository home page, locate the [Releases](https://github.com/OneBigUnit/K-Lazer/releases) section, and pick the version you wish to install. It is recommended that the most recent version is installed, which will be found at the top of the list.  
  
Under the release title and description, click the **'Assets'** link, and select the first link from the drop down.  
This should be called *'Source code  (zip)'*, and look like this:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54935549/149997037-fc9858e5-c651-4557-be41-7e366d9f4b91.png)  
  
Then save the zipped folder, and extract the files into your desired location.  
The application is now downloaded. Now just navigate to the save location, open the unzipped folder, and run the `K-Lazer.exe` file.

## Branches

The K-Lazer GitHub repository consists of 3 branches; namely:
* [Source](https://github.com/OneBigUnit/K-Lazer/tree/Source)
* [Build](https://github.com/OneBigUnit/K-Lazer/tree/Build)
* [Development](https://github.com/OneBigUnit/K-Lazer/tree/Development)  
  
These branches are each dedicated to 3 aspects of the project, as follows...

### Source

Source is the main branch of the project, and is dedicated to storing the unity source code to the currently released version of the project.  
With every new release *(See [Releases](#releases))*, this branch is updated with the corresponding source code, which can be opened in the unity editor.

### Build

Build is the second branch of the project, and is dedicated to storing the built version of the currently released version of the project.  
This branch contains the executable and all other necessary files to run the build of the project, and is updated to match the latest version of the project as with the [Source Branch](https://github.com/OneBigUnit/K-Lazer/tree/Source).

### Development

Development is the final branch of the project, and is dedicated to storing the unity source code for version yet to be released - this code will often not be functional, but is designed to show and store the experimental features that are currently being designed in the application.
The code in this branch may contains bugs or fatal errors, but should give insight into the progress being made in the development of K-Lazer.

## Releases

Official releases of K-Lazer can be found by navigating to the [Releases](https://github.com/OneBigUnit/K-Lazer/releases) section from the home page of the repository.
In that section is a list of all versions released, which can each be individually downloaded as per the [Usage Instructions]("#usage") above.
  
K-Lazer uses semantic versioning to label each official release.  
This is where the version number is arranged into the following format: `AA: BB: CC - ...`  
* The number at `AA` is incremented whenever a non-backwards compatible version is released, like a major overhaul of the application.
* The number at `BB` is incremented whenever a backwards compatible, major version is released, such as a feature update.
* The number at `CC` is incremented whenever a small patch or bug fix is made, not adding any new features to the application.
* The characters at `...` indicate the type of version that has been released, giving an indication as to the current stage of development.
  
You can read more on semantic versioning [here](https://semver.org/).
