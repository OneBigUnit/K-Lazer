## Introduction

K-Lazer is a project aiming to provide an interface from which teachers can interact with and engage their students. The project is designed to facilitate 
teaching with the use of a computer or interactive whiteboard, using a simple, sleek, and highly customizable overlay, made using the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/).  

K-Lazer comes with many features to help teachers in their lessons, all designed to be easy to access, so that they can focus on their class. 
These include a customizable laser pointer, annotation support, and screen shot / recording capabilties; all just a click away.
